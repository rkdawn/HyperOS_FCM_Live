/**
 * Xposed module entry: keeps FCM / GMS wake paths alive on HyperOS.
 *
 * Do not "modernize" away:
 * - Public class extending [XposedModule] with a no-arg constructor (proguard).
 * - Hook callbacks run in system_server / PowerKeeper: never throw out of them,
 *   never block the main thread, never switch to coroutines.
 * - The four FCM marker constants are shared with the settings list.
 *
 * Scope limits this module stays inside:
 * - Root is not module privilege. No `su`/`exec su` from a hook (watchdog risk),
 *   no SELinux changes, no injection into GMS or into a target app, no cloud
 *   (云控) countermeasures, no global writes upstream of this module's own
 *   three documented write sites.
 *
 * Defence placement, which decides whether a hook is worth having:
 * - A live path whose current branch does not hit GMS → keep a **sentinel**
 *   hook, and word the user-facing copy as "armed", never as "took effect",
 *   until it is confirmed at runtime.
 * - A mechanism that is dead end-to-end → do not add a hook; use cheap
 *   observation instead.
 * - **A behaviour change that has not been confirmed at runtime is not made.**
 *   When in doubt, ship one log line that states the assumption instead — a
 *   guess you can read beats a change you cannot verify.

     *    miui-services.jar does `new-instance` it.
     * 2. does anything ever reach the real implementation
     *    `MiuiNetworkManagementService#doDesSocketForUid(String, int[], boolean)`?
     *
     * Both are answered at runtime here; nothing is modified, and only the first few
     * calls are logged (plus every call that touches a GMS uid).
     *
     * Three layers are watched, because the transport hops twice:
     *
     * `WhetstoneActivityManager` (static, client) ──AIDL "whetstone.activity"──▶
     *     `WhetstoneActivityManagerService` (server) ──▶ `MiuiNetworkManagementService` (impl)
     *
     * A single-layer probe could miss the call entirely if the server reaches netd on
     * its own, so all three are instrumented read-only.
     *
     * Why this stays an observation slot rather than being retired: a static
     * "zero callers" verdict would be a **false negative** here. The service
     * half is published — `adb shell service list` includes `whetstone.activity`
     * — so arbitrary processes can reach it over binder, and the client half is
     * not in the services.jar / miui-services.jar corpus that a dex grep covers.
     * Entry points therefore cannot be counted statically at all, which is
     * exactly why they are counted here, at runtime.
     *
     * Current reading on this device: structurally reachable, zero calls in the
     * ~6 minute observation window ⇒ "structurally reachable, never triggered",
     * **not** dead code. Only sustained zero-traffic over a much longer window
     * justifies downgrading — never a `invoke-*` count.

     * greeze (`com.miui.server.greeze.GreezeManagerService`): the ROM's freeze /

     *
     * The findings every decision below rests on (OS4 V816, each one read back
     * from the running device, not from the disassembly alone):
     *
     * - `adb shell dumpsys greezer` is the one command worth running first: it
     *   prints the live Settings (enable / fz_timeout / monitor),
     *   `mCurrentCNPolicy`, `mGmsLimitEnabled`, the frozen process list, the
     *   greeze history, **and the real contents of `mBroadcastTargetWhiteList`**
     *   — 8 entries on this device, all Tencent / Feishu / Rimet. GMS is not one
     *   of them, which is the whole reason the broadcast gates below exist.
     * - Policy dispatch is Domestic here (`mCurrentCNPolicy: 1`, region CN), so
     *   `InternationalPolicyManager#isPushApp` is dead code on this device, and
     *   `isPushApp == true` means *restrict* that app's network — the opposite of
     *   what the name suggests.
     * - GMS does not enter the freeze path at all: per-uid accounting reads
     *   `uid=10133 frozen=0s` after 15h and `noControl` reports
     *   `no_freeze:invisible`. The network hooks in this file are therefore
     *   defence in depth, not the fix — see [hookDomesticRestrictNet].
     * - The real MIUI network engine is netd's
     *   `OemNetdListener.setMiuiFirewallRule` (0 rules installed at runtime
     *   here). The older `enablemiuistandby enable` standby chain is a dead
     *   letter on this ROM — dnsproxyd answers `500 Command not recognized` — and
     *   is intercepted only as an OTA hedge.
     *
     * A quiet night proves nothing on its own; HOOKS_AND_DIAGNOSTICS.md §6.4
     * fixes the wording for that case ("not observed in this window", never
     * "not needed").

     * P0 #1 (action list 2.1): `DomesticPolicyManager#isRestrictNet(I)Z` → false for GMS.
     *
     * Polarity matters and was wrong in every earlier round, so it is recorded
     * here from the bytecode instead of from the method names:
     *
     *   isNeedRestictNetworkPolicy(uid) == mMessageApp.contains(pkg)   // @16cc44
     *   isRestrictNet(uid)               == !isNeedRestictNetworkPolicy(uid)   // @172c90
     *
     * `mMessageApp` is therefore the **exempt** list (544 entries on this ROM,
     * probed at runtime: GMS absent), and the only caller of `isRestrictNet` is
     * inside `GreezeManagerService.freezeUids(...)`:
     *
     *   if (isRestrictNet(uid)) { flags |= 0x0C00; closeSocketForAurogon(uid);
     *                             updateAurogonUidRule(uid, true); }
     *
     * So true really means "restrict this uid's network", and GMS — being absent
     * from the exempt list — would get its sockets torn if it were ever frozen.
     *
     * Currently inert: greezer history shows GMS never enters the freeze path on
     * this device (E7-3 closed, negative). Shipped as defence: if a future ROM or
     * state freezes GMS, this keeps the network restriction off. Only the GMS uid
     * is forced — every other uid proceeds unchanged, so the instant-messaging
     * apps that *are* on the exempt list keep their existing policy.

     * at sleep entry and let through only `sleep_mode_network_white_apps`;
     * GMS was not on that list, so the FCM socket was cut silently and only
     * came back on the next heartbeat. The receiver's order at entry is:
     *
     *   setSleepModeWhitelistUidRules()   // pushes added=true for every uid in mSleepModeWhitelistUids
     *   enableSleepModeChain(true)        // opens the chain
     *
     * so injecting GMS into the set before the rules are pushed was enough,
     * and exit revokes symmetrically via clearSleepModeWhitelistUidRules().
     *
     * **Why it is only a sentinel now (2026-10-02).** On OS4/V816 this path
     * never runs: sleep mode does not filter per uid at all — PowerKeeper's
     * `PhoneSleepModeController#applySleepConfig` switches WiFi and mobile data
     * off outright (measured 01:38:00→07:08:57, GCM `net=-1`). Reading the
     * armed hook as protection is what once made an all-night cutoff look like
     * a working setup, so the install-time line says so outright and the real
     * keepalive lives in [hookSleepModeNetworkKeepalive].
     *
     * **Sentinels.** Both arms report the first time the ROM actually runs
     * them (`sleep-mode sentinel: legacy path FIRED — …`). On V816 neither
     * line should ever appear; if one does, the ROM generation changed, the
     * "cuts in PowerKeeper" reading no longer covers the device, and the
     * conclusion has to be rebuilt from that log rather than from this file.
     * The two arms are armed **independently** for the same reason: they back
     * two different claims, and until 2026-10-03 a missing whitelist method
     * returned early, which also skipped the chain hook — on such a ROM the
     * sleep-exit reconnect would have run unhooked and unreported.

     * Relaxed WiFi weak-signal switch, hooked in system_server.
     *
     * What the ROM does without us (measured on-device, V816, see
     * HOOKS_AND_DIAGNOSTICS.md §3.9): `AmlMiuiThirdPartScorer` keeps a legacy
     * score in `mLegacyIntScore` and turns it into a usable/unusable verdict at
     * a **hardcoded** 50 inside `notifyScoreAndIsUsable()`. A single call there
     * publishes everything outward — `notifyScoreUpdate(sessionId, score)` for
     * the value and `notifyStatusUpdate(sessionId, isUsable)` for the verdict —
     * so a score below 50 reaches `WifiScoreReport` as "not usable", which sets
     * the network `+EXITING` and moves the default network to cellular for 30 s.
     * Both write paths into `mLegacyIntScore` converge on that one method, so
     * it is the cheapest point at which the verdict can be withheld.
     *
     * What this hook changes, and what it deliberately does not:
     * - the clamp exists only for the lifetime of the call; the field is
     *   restored in a `finally`, so the class's own state machine still sees
     *   the real reading and nothing is persisted anywhere — this is why it
     *   replaces the earlier idea of lowering the `cloud_min_rssi_*` settings
     *   keys (those survive in `settings_system.xml` after an uninstall, and
     *   their direction turned out to be unproven anyway);
     * - the score value published upstream is what decides whether WiFi stays
     *   the default network, so reporting the floor *is* the intervention;
     * - a real failure that does not travel through this scorer — WiFi leaving,
     *   carrier or UI decisions, validation failures — is untouched;
     * - how far down it reaches is the user's call, not ours. Scores below
     *   [Prefs.KEY_WIFI_WEAK_SIGNAL_FLOOR] go through unmodified, so a link bad
     *   enough to be past saving is still handed to a mechanism that can pick
     *   another network. Every rescue is conditional on that floor, and the
     *   master switch must be on for it to be consulted at all.
     *
     * Known uncovered exit, deliberately not handled yet: the ROM also calls
     * `notifySwitchNetworkByOtherStrategies type = 1003`, which bypasses this
     * score channel entirely. It was observed 27 times in one gaming window
     * without ever causing a switch, so it is a watch item and not a fixed
     * gap — if a switch is later reported while every sub-floor score stayed
     * unflipped, check that call first before suspecting this hook. See
     * HOOKS_AND_DIAGNOSTICS.md §6.3.
     *
     * Class resolution note, which is the reason this one is not a plain
     * `classLoader.loadClass`: the class is **not reachable from system_server's
     * own classloader**. `miui-wifi-service.jar` is loaded separately (the build
     * that runs it is the one whose logcat emits `AmlMiuiThirdPartScorer` from
     * the system_server pid), so both call sites below return ClassNotFound
     * while the class is plainly live in the process — the first attempt at this
     * hook reported "absent" on a ROM where the class was demonstrably running.
     * The fallback therefore walks to the loader that did load it, through the
     * binder of a service whose implementation comes from the same jar.

     * off outright, so no per-app whitelist can preserve the FCM channel —
     * measured on-device 01:38:00→07:08:57 with GCM reporting `net=-1`,
     * i.e. no network reachable at all, cellular included.
     *
     * Both switches are flipped directly inside `applySleepConfig`:
     *   CommonAdapter.setDataEnabled(TelephonyManager, false)   (static)
     *   WifiManager.setWifiEnabled(false)
     * so those two are hooked here rather than anything in system_server.
     *
     * Only calls whose stack carries `PhoneSleepModeController
     * #applySleepConfig` are touched: a user switching WiFi off by hand has
     * no such frame and still works.
     *
     * ## Why the cutoff calls are stopped here instead of skipped upstream
     *
     * `applySleepConfig` jumps over the whole cutoff block when
     * `key_open_earthquake_warning` reads 1, and an earlier revision answered
     * that read with 1 — the vendor's own "must stay reachable" escape hatch.
     * That shortcut is all-or-nothing: it skips `setDataEnabled(false)` and
     * `setWifiEnabled(false)` **and, with them, the
     * `SleepState.setPreviousEnable`/`writeToDb` calls that record which
     * radios were on before sleep**. Skipping the record is harmless while
     * neither radio is ever cut, but it makes "keep WiFi, let mobile data go"
     * impossible to express — and that is the entire point of the data
     * sub-switch. Worse, `restoreSleepConfig` reads those same bits back to
     * decide what to turn on again, so a radio cut without a recorded
     * previous-enable would stay off after sleep with nothing to restore it.
     *
     * So the ROM now runs its full path and the cutoff calls are stopped here
     * instead. `SleepState` is a bitmask (1 = data, 2 = WiFi, 4 = WiFi AP,
     * 16 = keyguard notification, 32 = FOD, 128 = pickup) and
     * `setPreviousEnable(ch, true)` also sets the matching `restore` bit, so
     * every radio that was on before sleep is guaranteed to be restored. The
     * one visible change is that the keyguard-notification leg of that block
     * now runs as the ROM intended, instead of being skipped along with the
     * radios. That leg is not cosmetic: at `29e42e` the ROM reads
     * `Settings.System "wakeup_for_keyguard_notification"` (default -1),
     * stores it in `SleepState.previousNotification`, sets the restore bit 16
     * when it was on, and then `putInt(..., 0)` — i.e. sleep turns off "light
     * the screen when a lock-screen notification arrives", and
     * `restoreSleepConfig` (`29feb2`) writes the previous value back on exit.
     * Letting it run means notifications do not wake the screen overnight;
     * skipping it (what the flag shortcut did) leaves that on, so every
     * overnight push lights the screen. It is the ROM's own power saving and
     * this module has no opinion about it either way — it runs because the
     * block runs, not because we chose it.
     *
     * Policy — each radio follows its own switch: WiFi under
     * `Prefs.KEY_SLEEP_KEEPALIVE`, mobile data under
     * `Prefs.KEY_SLEEP_KEEPALIVE_DATA`. Both keys are read lazily at each cutoff
     * call, so a flip lands on the next sleep entry without a reboot, and
     * neither key gates the other — a night that keeps exactly one radio up is
     * a configuration the user can ask for, which is why the experiment screen
     * draws the two switches as peers rather than as a master and a sub. Who
     * may actually use the restored network is still decided by Doze's per-uid
     * chain, which this hook leaves alone.
     *
     * Two limits are stated here rather than left to be discovered:
     *  - On the degraded path ([hookSleepModeEarthquakeFlag]) neither cutoff
     *    interceptor runs at all — that branch skips the whole cutoff block.
     *    It is only reachable when one of the two cutoff methods cannot be
     *    hooked, and the install-time log says so outright.
     *  - Both interceptors require the stack to carry
     *    [SLEEP_CONTROLLER_CLASS]`#applySleepConfig` / `#restoreSleepConfig`
     *    ([calledFromSleepApply] / [calledFromSleepConfig]), and that class is
     *    the OS4/V816 home of sleep mode. On a ROM whose sleep mode lives
     *    elsewhere — OS3 goes through system_server's per-uid chain, which is
     *    what the legacy arms below exist for — the predicate can never match,
     *    so this switch intercepts nothing and the radios are cut exactly as if
     *    it were off. That is a **silent no-op, not a failure**: both hooks are
     *    installed and the install log says so, so never read a healthy-looking
     *    log as "the switch is doing something". Which side of the fork a
     *    device is on comes from the `Sleep-mode legacy per-uid chain armed: …`
     *    line and the two `legacy path FIRED` sentinels, not from this switch.

    /**
     * Keep GMS out of PowerKeeper's per-uid network restriction set.
     *
     * AppStandbyController.setUidState(int uid, boolean allow) is where the
     * per-uid decision is made. The second parameter really is named "allow"
     * — the method prints "setUidState, uid = %d allow = %b" itself. Its body
     * stores the value into mUidState and then drives DeviceIdlePolicyHelper,
     * so this single call is the convergence point for standby restriction.
     * The downstream helper method is obfuscated and its name differs per
     * ROM generation — OS3 calls s:(IZ)V, OS4 calls r:(IZ)V (both classes also
     * carry the other letter with a different signature). It has exactly one
     * call site in either generation, so no second in-process path can
     * restrict GMS behind setUidState's back. Do not hard-code the letter:
     * only setUidState itself is hooked, and its (IZ)V signature is stable.
     *
     * Do not locate it by name: PowerKeeper declares six methods called
     * setUidState, and the (IZ)V signature alone exists in four classes —
     * AppStandbyController, DeviceIdleController, KillProcessController and
     * SensorController. Only AppStandbyController's feeds the standby network
     * state; the other three drive the doze temporary allowlist, process
     * killing and sensor policy, and a fifth same-named method on
     * AppClusterController moves cluster membership. Match on class plus
     * signature, never on the bare name. The standby chain was walked through
     * the whole dex (OS4, miui-services) and is single-call-site at every
     * level: AppStandbyController#setUidState → DeviceIdlePolicyHelper.r →
     * q → IUsageStatsManager.setAppInactive(pkg, !allow, userId).
     *
     * Only the argument is rewritten. Do not pre-seed mUidState to true: when
     * the incoming value equals the cached one the method returns early, so a
     * true cache would suppress the recovery path instead of triggering it.
     * Forcing allow=true lets the method converge: a restriction attempt sees
     * allow(true) differ from the cached false, then writes true and lifts the
     * restriction. If the divergence ever needs fixing, the safe direction is
     * to force the cache to false, never true — false guarantees the branch
     * actually executes.
     *
     * Not a fix by itself: calling setUidState(gmsUid, true) from outside does
     * not bypass the early return — the early return lives inside that same
     * method, and a cache of true makes the call a no-op, which is exactly the
     * divergent case it would be meant to repair. It also cannot converge the
     * cache with reality: mUidState only consults external state on the first
     * seeding (getUidState), afterwards it is write-only. The only working
     * form is the pair — force the cache to false, then invoke setUidState
     * (uid, true) so the body runs end to end. Because that body also fires
     * sendConnectivityActionToApp(uid), doing it on a timer means waking GMS
     * repeatedly; if it is ever added, drive it from events (module load,
     * screen-on, the pre-flight we already run before delivering a broadcast)
     * with a long minimum interval, never from a periodic tick.
     *
     * That divergence stays unimplemented on purpose: every observable signal
     * on the test device says it is not happening (dumpsys netpolicy shows
     * UID 10133 as policy=4 ALLOW_METERED_BACKGROUND with background
     * restriction off, and GMS is present in all three DeviceIdle whitelist
     * sections), so adding reflexive cache writes would be speculative risk.
     * Four root-free checks decide it, and they are the whole evidence base —
     * re-run them before claiming the gap has closed or opened:
     * am get-standby-bucket com.google.android.gms (5 = ACTIVE),
     * dumpsys netpolicy (policy=4 for UID 10133),
     * dumpsys greezer (frozen=0s for uid 10133),
     * dumpsys deviceidle whitelist (GMS in user, system and system-excidle).
     *
     * Known residual gap: if GMS gets restricted out-of-band (never through
     * setUidState) while mUidState still reads true, even an allow=true call
     * short-circuits and nothing lifts the block. P4 recovery does not cover
     * it — it is an outbound "please reconnect" nudge to GMS/GSF, not a lift of
     * a uid restriction, and it only fires on sleep-mode exit or a
     * MILLET_NO_RESTRICT_APP repair, neither of which recurs on its own.

     * module actually runs in.
     *
     * The op code is not in the SDK either — the public `AppOpsManager` only
     * exposes the name-based overloads — so both methods are resolved by
     * reflection and invoked through [XposedInterface.getInvoker], the same
     * route the module already uses for other hidden framework methods.
     *
     * Identity is cleared around the calls. The hook runs on the broadcast's
     * binder thread, so without it the ROM would judge the *sender's* uid:
     * `setMode` enforces `MANAGE_APP_OPS_MODES`, which the module only holds as
     * system_server (uid 1000). Scope is these calls and nothing else — clearing

     * Logging is left to the caller because the two callers want different

     * one line for the whole list. The one exception is a failure, which is

     * A /proc/net/tcp pass (looking for an ESTABLISHED MCS socket) was implemented

     *   - It is unreadable from the system_server SELinux domain: the file is
     *     labelled proc_net_tcp_udp and Enforcing gives system_server no read on
     *     it (adb's shell domain does — adb being able to read it proves nothing
     *     about what a hook can read). Android has also been closing /proc/net off
     *     since 10 for side-channel reasons, and every device this module targets
     *     runs far newer than that, so "it may be readable on other builds" was
     *     never a real possibility. Making it readable would mean loosening
     *     SELinux, which is off the table.
     *   - Even granted the permission it would answer the wrong question. The two
     *     ways this ROM actually starves GMS are DNS interception and firewall
     *     DROP; neither notifies the endpoint, so the socket stays ESTABLISHED
     *     and the table reports a healthy connection over a dead one. The one
     *     path that genuinely closes sockets, closeSocketForAurogon, has a
     *     measured hit rate of zero for GMS on this ROM.

     *   **only** — there is no `isPushApp` slot. So no `invoke-interface` edge

     *   (`AurogonImmobulusMode#restorePolicyManager`; `dumpsys greezer` reports
     *   `mCurrentCNPolicy: 1` with the force-CN flag false), so
     *   `InternationalPolicyManager` is never instantiated here and this hook
     *   is inert locally.

     * Two consequences follow, and both are intentional:
     *
     * - No International counterpart for the P0 #1
     *   `DomesticPolicyManager#isRestrictNet` hook is added. Nothing on this
     *   device can execute it, so its behaviour could never be observed —
     *   unverifiable risk in exchange for zero local benefit.
